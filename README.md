## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **REST Assured**: A Java library for testing RESTful APIs.
- **Apache JMeter**: A tool for performance testing and measuring the performance of web applications.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Maven (for REST Assured)
- Apache JMeter (for JMeter test plans)

### Running REST Assured Tests

1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Ensure Maven is installed and configured.
3. Compile and run the `Evaluation_first.java` test script using your preferred IDE or command line.

### Running JMeter Tests

1. Open Apache JMeter.
2. Load the `Thread Group Evaluation.jmx` test plan.
3. Execute the test plan to simulate API requests.

|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Primary Use           | Functional API testing                  | Performance and load testing          |
| Interface             | Code-based (Java)                       | GUI-based                             |
| Supported Protocols   | HTTP                                    | HTTP, FTP, JDBC, and more             |
| Learning Curve        | Requires Java knowledge                 | User-friendly GUI                     |
| Extensibility         | High (via Java code)                    | Moderate (via plugins and scripting)  |

## 📸 Sample Test Screenshots

The repository includes screenshots demonstrating the execution of various HTTP methods using both tools:

- GET Method Test
- POST Method Test
- PUT Method Test
- DELETE Method Test
- PATCH Method Test

These visuals provide a comparative view of how each tool handles different API requests.
